                    The landing page of the website is confusing and messy.
                </li>
                <l1>
                    The design is inconsistent and not pleasing to the eye since there are too much text and the alignment is close to nowhere.
                </l1>
                <li>
                    The website is not responsive, it does not prioritize the needs of its users.

                Grid Layout

            <ul class="content">
                <li>
                    The grid is missing both margins and paddings, which results in the contents of the website being misaligned and unpleasant to look at.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no utilization of the grid structure and layout, therefore the information and components it contains are disorganized.
